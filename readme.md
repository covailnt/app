* Make sure you have `Node 8.x` installed
* Don't use **Yarn** (no need with **NPM v5** because it is just as fast and creates a lock file)
* Use an editor that has **eslint** and **editorConfig** installed and adhere to error messages as they arise
* Please send **PRs** rather than push directly to a branch
* Most of our development work will be handled on the `development` branch
